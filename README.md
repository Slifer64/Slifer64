## 🚀 About Me
I am a robotics software engineer with **7+ years** of experience building real-time control, motion planning, and 3D perception systems for industrial manipulators. My work spans from **research-driven prototypes** to **deployed factory solutions**, with a focus on:

- **Robot kinematics, dynamics & control**  
- **Collision-free, time-optimal motion planning** (RRT, PRM, numerical optimization)  
- **Learning-based motion generation** (DMPs, deep learning)  
- **3D perception-driven manipulation** (RGB-D & stereo vision)  
- **Scalable robotics software architectures** with C++/ROS 2 & Docker  

I enjoy bridging **academic research** with **industrial-grade implementations**, mentoring teams, and turning complex algorithms into robust, production-ready code.
